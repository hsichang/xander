It’s going to take more than the space provided here to sum up the ideas and talent of NYC’s Xander Duell, who has fused decades’ worth of nuance into these thirteen songs. The implication in the title of this one is at least somewhat correct in that the experimental nature of Duell’s music rears its head in style and content atop songwriting that touches the emotional core without hesitation or regret. There is joy and sadness here, electronics and guitars, grandeur alongside the neon-lit sleaze. Calibrate your expectations appropriately on this one, but be prepared to have them shattered by this outsider work, in the spirit of Scott Walker’s numbered albums and the prime cut of ‘70s soft rock.

    Xander Duell exists in a parallel universe.  Experimental Tapes: Volume 2, released in 2011 on Mexican Summer, was a bit too much for most people to wrap their heads around.

    Though the record was far from being high-profile, it did attract a disparate array of musician fans.

    For his follow-up full-length, Wade Laiste, Xander was able to bring together the unlikely musical pairing of producers Andrew Wyatt of pop behemoths Miike Snow, and Damon McMahon, the voice behind Brooklyn’s Amen Dunes.

    Recorded in Sear Sound, one of New York City’s most renowned and historic recording studios, with a hyper-real rhythm section composed of David Bowie’s drummer (Sterling Campbell) and Maxwell’s bassist (Hod David), as well as musical accompaniment by producers Andrew Wyatt and Damon McMahon, the result is a surrealist medicated daydream coasting along the deepest and most immaculately precise grooves. Where Experimental Tapes: Volume 2 was raw and inward bedroom-pop, Wade Laiste is slick and extroverted future soul.

    It’s David Lynch blues & pill-head 2013 Avant-soul born from some of the deepest and most unusually combined musicianship on any record to come out of New York City for quite some time.
